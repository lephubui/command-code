# Problem Statement: You are tasked with designing a Python function called solution() that processes a series of distinct requests or operations.
# These operations consist of a list of two integers: one signifies the type of operation, and the other is the operand.

# There are three kinds of actions you will need to handle:
#
# Adding a number to the set (operation type 0). If the number is already in the set, you should ignore it.
# Removing a number from the set (operation type 1). Whenever this operation is invoked, it is guaranteed that the number exists in the set.
# Finding the maximum number in the set (operation type 2).
#
# The list of operations is delivered to your function as a 2D array, where each subarray contains two values â€” the type of operation and the operand. 
# The function should output an array of results for every operation. For operation types 0 and 1, the function should return the count of unique elements in the set after the operation. 
# For operation type 2, the function should return the maximum number in the set. If the set is empty, the function should return -1.
# Constraints:
# The number of operations can be as large as 10^5.
# The integers involved in the operations can range from -10^5 to 10^5.
# The operation type will always be one of the three specified (0, 1, or 2).
