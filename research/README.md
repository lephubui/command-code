# Master's Thesis: Static Analysis of Binary Files for Vulnerability Detection

## Introduction

This repository documents my master’s thesis research at the University of Idaho, which focuses on the static analysis of binary files to detect software vulnerabilities. The primary objective of this work is to enhance the security of networked systems by identifying security flaws in compiled C++ code.

## Project Overview

During this research, I used a static analysis tool designed to inspect binary executables and uncover potential vulnerabilities that may not be visible at the source code level. By analyzing compiled C++ binaries, the tool aims to improve code safety and assist developers in mitigating risks associated with software vulnerabilities in networked environments.

## Key Features

- Automated analysis of compiled C++ binaries
- Detection of common security flaws and unsafe patterns
- Focus on improving the security posture of networked systems

## Acknowledgments

This work was conducted as part of my master’s thesis at the University of Idaho, under the guidance of faculty and research advisors.
